## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidated learnings - check this FIRST before starting work -->

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7 in `src/`
- **Backend**: Tauri 2 (Rust) in `src-tauri/`
- **Package Manager**: Bun

### Conventions
- Use `@tauri-apps/api` `invoke()` for frontend-to-backend IPC
- Use `bun run tauri dev` for full app development
- Use `bun run dev` for frontend-only development

### Gotchas
- `tauri-plugin-store` is used for settings persistence (alternative to custom keyring since tauri-plugin-keyring may not be available for Tauri 2)
- tree-sitter and tree-sitter-highlight versions must match (0.24)
- reqwest uses `rustls-tls` (not native-tls) to avoid OpenSSL dependency issues on macOS

## 2026-01-30 - T001
**Workflow**: Speckit
**Feature**: Local-First GitLab MR Review (001-local-mr-review)

### Implemented
- Added all Rust dependencies to src-tauri/Cargo.toml:
  - sqlx 0.8 with runtime-tokio and sqlite features
  - reqwest 0.12 with json and rustls-tls features
  - tree-sitter 0.24 and tree-sitter-highlight 0.24
  - thiserror 2 for error handling
  - tokio 1 with sync and time features
  - chrono 0.4 with serde feature
  - tauri-plugin-store 2 for settings storage

### Files Changed
- src-tauri/Cargo.toml

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- Cargo check passed; all dependencies compatible with Tauri 2.9.5
- 573 packages locked; first build fetches many transitive dependencies
