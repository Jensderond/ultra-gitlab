## Codebase Patterns
- Settings use `tauri-plugin-store` (JSON file), not SQLite. Add new fields by: adding store key const, load block in `load_settings()`, set call in `save_settings()`, field in `AppSettings` struct + Default impl.
- New command files in `src-tauri/src/commands/` need 3 registrations: pub mod + pub use in `mod.rs`, import + generate_handler! in `lib.rs`.
- Use `pub(crate)` visibility for helper functions shared between command modules (e.g., `load_settings`, `save_settings`, `settings_cache`).
- `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` on all DTOs sent to frontend.
- `AppError` has convenience constructors like `invalid_input_field()`, `not_found_with_id()`, etc.
- Companion server service: `services::companion_server` has `start_companion_server()`, `stop_companion_server()`, `is_companion_server_running()`.
- Frontend dist path: In dev mode, `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/../dist`; in prod, Tauri resource dir. Both checked via `index.html` existence.
- Transport layer: `src/services/transport.ts` detects Tauri vs browser via `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. `tauri.ts` uses `transportInvoke` instead of direct `@tauri-apps/api` invoke. `isTauri` exported from `services/index.ts`.
- All `@tauri-apps/` imports should be dynamic — any new feature using Tauri APIs must follow this pattern.
- `tauriListen()` and `openExternalUrl()` in `transport.ts` handle Tauri vs browser seamlessly.
- Package manager: bun (not npm/yarn). Typecheck: `bunx tsc --noEmit`.

- When replacing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with SVG content, use `data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,${encodeURIComponent(svg)}` as an `<img>` src — avoids XSS while preserving visual output.
- To replace `useEffect(() => setState(x), [dep])` derived state pattern: use a ref to track the previous value and reset during render with guards (e.g., `if (dep !== prevRef.current) { prevRef.current = dep; setState(x); }`).
- Settings page is now at `src/pages/Settings/` (directory with index.tsx orchestrator). Sub-components are in the same directory. CSS is still at `src/pages/Settings.css`.
- When decomposing a page: keep the CSS file in its original location, import with `../Settings.css` from the new directory. Delete the old monolithic `.tsx` file so the directory `index.tsx` takes priority.

- Replaced `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: qrSvg }}` with safe `<img>` element using data URI
- Changed `<div>` to `<img>` with `alt` text for accessibility
- Updated CSS: removed `display: flex`, child `svg` selector (no longer needed with `<img>`), added `box-sizing: content-box`
- Files changed: `src/pages/Settings.tsx`, `src/pages/Settings.css`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - QR SVG is generated by Rust backend via `getCompanionQrSvg()` — it's trusted content, but `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is still an anti-pattern
  - CSS had `.companion-qr-code svg` child selector that targeted inline SVG — switching to `<img>` requires removing those child selectors
  - Data URI approach: `data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,${encodeURIComponent(svgString)}` works well for trusted SVG rendering

## 2026-02-18 - US-002
- Created `src/hooks/useCompanionAuth.ts` — encapsulates the `fetch('/api/instances')` session check
- Hook returns `{ isAuthenticated: boolean | null, isChecking: boolean }`, accepts `skip` param
- Updated `src/App.tsx` to use `useCompanionAuth(isTauri || location.pathname === '/auth')` instead of inline fetch-in-useEffect
- Updated `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx` to use `useCompanionAuth()` instead of inline session check
- Both callers use separate useEffects to react to auth state (navigate on auth result)
- Files changed: `src/hooks/useCompanionAuth.ts` (new), `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The two auth checks had subtly different behaviors: App.tsx redirects to `/auth` on failure, AuthPage redirects to `/mrs` on success — the hook must return the raw state so callers can decide
  - The `skip` parameter is important — App.tsx needs to skip the check when running in Tauri mode or when already on the auth page
  - `browserAuthChecked` state in App.tsx was initialized to `isTauri` (true in desktop mode) — the replacement uses `!isTauri && companionAuth.isAuthenticated !== true` guard

- Replaced two `useEffect` anti-patterns in `CommandPalette.tsx`:
  1. `useEffect(() => setSelectedIndex(0), [query])` → inline render-time check using `prevQueryRef`
  2. `useEffect(() => { setQuery(''); setSelectedIndex(0); focus(); }, [isOpen])` → split into: render-time state reset via `prevIsOpenRef` transition detection + retained `useEffect` only for DOM focus
- Files changed: `src/components/CommandPalette/CommandPalette.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The "reset state on prop change" useEffect pattern is replaced by tracking previous values with refs and doing conditional setState during render — React handles the re-render correctly
  - Guard setState calls with value checks (e.g., `if (selectedIndex !== 0)`) to avoid unnecessary re-renders when state already has the target value
  - DOM side effects (focus, scroll) still need useEffect — only state derivation moves to render

- Replaced array-index keys with stable unique keys in 4 files:
  - `CommandItem.tsx`: shortcut parts use the part string itself as key (parts are unique within a shortcut)
  - `Settings.tsx`: pattern list uses `${index}-${pattern}` composite key (patterns can be duplicated/edited)
  - `DiffViewer.tsx`: null hunks use `loading-${index}`, real hunks use `${oldStart}-${newStart}`
  - `JobLogPage.tsx`: ANSI segments use text offset as key; log entries use `line-${lineNumber}` or `section-${name}`
- Files changed: `src/components/CommandPalette/CommandItem.tsx`, `src/pages/Settings.tsx`, `src/components/DiffViewer/DiffViewer.tsx`, `src/pages/JobLogPage.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For ANSI segments without IDs, accumulating a text offset produces a stable key since segments are parsed deterministically
  - DiffHunk's `oldStart`/`newStart` pair uniquely identifies a hunk — good stable key
  - LogEntry lines have `lineNumber`, sections have `name` — both are unique within a parsed log
  - When items can be duplicated (like editable pattern strings), a composite `${index}-${value}` key is the best compromise

## 2026-02-18 - US-005
- Removed 11 dead source files (8 .ts/.tsx + 3 .css):
  - `src/hooks/useSyncStatus.ts` — unused hook
  - `src/themes/index.ts` — barrel file, other files import theme sub-modules directly
  - `src/components/InstanceSetup/index.ts` — barrel file, Settings imports InstanceSetup directly
  - `src/components/Monaco/collapseRegions.ts` — unused utility
  - `src/components/SyncStatus/` — entire directory removed (PendingActionsIndicator, SyncLogPanel, SyncStatusBar + their CSS + index.ts)
- Files changed: 11 files deleted, 1257 lines removed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The SyncStatus components formed a self-contained island — all internal imports (useSyncStatus hook, sibling components) were only referenced within the cluster itself. Safe to remove as a unit.
  - `themes/index.ts` was a dead barrel — other files import specific sub-modules (deriveTheme, types, kanagawa-wave, monacoAdapter) directly
  - `InstanceSetup/index.ts` was bypassed — Settings imports `InstanceSetup/InstanceSetup` directly

## 2026-02-18 - US-006
- Replaced barrel import `import { CommentInput } from './index'` with direct import `import CommentInput from './CommentInput'` in InlineComment.tsx
- Files changed: `src/components/CommentPanel/InlineComment.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CommentInput uses `export default` — direct import uses default import syntax (no braces), unlike the named re-export from the barrel
  - The barrel `index.ts` re-exports with `export { default as CommentInput }` — consumers within the same directory should import directly to avoid circular dependency risk and improve tree-shaking

## 2026-02-18 - US-007
- Converted `renderSegments()` helper in JobLogPage.tsx to a proper named component `AnsiSegments` that returns a fragment with the segment spans
- Changed `useState(ACTIVE_STATUSES.has(initialStatus))` to lazy initializer `useState(() => ACTIVE_STATUSES.has(initialStatus))`
- Removed unnecessary `useMemo` wrappers from `unresolvedCount` and `approvedCount` in MyMRDetailPage.tsx — these were trivially cheap `.filter().length` calls
- DiffLine.tsx:122 `renderHighlightedContent()` referenced in PRD no longer exists — the file is 89 lines with no inline render functions
- Files changed: `src/pages/JobLogPage.tsx`, `src/pages/MyMRDetailPage.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When converting a render helper to a component, wrap the returned array in a `<>...</>` fragment
  - PRD line numbers become stale after previous stories modify files — always search for the actual function/pattern name rather than relying on line numbers
  - `useMemo` around `.filter().length` on small arrays (reviewers, threads) is unnecessary overhead — only memoize expensive computations

## 2026-02-18 - US-008
- Decomposed monolithic `src/pages/Settings.tsx` (1505 lines) into `src/pages/Settings/` directory with 12 focused sub-components
- Created orchestrator `index.tsx` (70 lines) that imports and renders all sections
- Extracted components:
  - `UpdatesSection.tsx` (88 lines) — version info and update downloads
  - `InstancesSection.tsx` (113 lines) — instance list management
  - `InstanceItem.tsx` (147 lines) — single instance row with inline token editing
  - `SyncSettingsSection.tsx` (142 lines) — sync interval and scope
  - `CompanionServerSection.tsx` (210 lines) — companion server toggle, port config
  - `CompanionActivePanel.tsx` (57 lines) — QR code, PIN, device list when server is on
  - `CompanionDeviceList.tsx` (55 lines) — authorized device list with revoke
  - `AppearanceSection.tsx` (212 lines) — theme swatches, custom theme editor, font selector
  - `NotificationsSection.tsx` (122 lines) — notification toggles
  - `CollapsePatternsEditor.tsx` (128 lines) — file collapse pattern management
  - `ShortcutEditor.tsx` (239 lines) — keyboard shortcut customization
- Deleted old `src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- CSS stays at `src/pages/Settings.css` (imported via `../Settings.css` from the new directory)
- `App.tsx` import `'./pages/Settings'` resolves to directory `index.tsx` automatically
- Files changed: 1 deleted, 12 created
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When converting `src/pages/Foo.tsx` to `src/pages/Foo/index.tsx`, existing imports like `'./pages/Foo'` resolve automatically — no import changes needed in consumers
  - The old `.tsx` file MUST be deleted or it will take priority over the directory's `index.tsx`
  - Token editing state (editingTokenId, tokenInput, etc.) was lifted to the parent InstancesSection — better to push it down into `InstanceItem` so each item owns its edit state independently
  - Components like CompanionServerSection that have "enabled" content panels benefit from extracting the active-state content into a separate presentational component
