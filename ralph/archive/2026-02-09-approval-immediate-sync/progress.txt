## Codebase Patterns
- Settings page uses sub-components (ShortcutEditor, CollapsePatternsEditor) for each settings section
- Service wrappers in tauri.ts provide typed invoke calls; export from index.ts for consumers
- Settings store uses separate keys per concern — collapse patterns stored independently from sync config

## 2026-02-09 - US-006
- Added CollapsePatternsEditor component to Settings page
- Displays list of glob patterns with text input + remove button per row
- "Add pattern" button appends new empty row
- Changes save immediately on blur (trimming empty patterns) or on remove
- Loads patterns on mount via getCollapsePatterns()
- Added CSS styles for the collapse patterns editor section
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - handlePatternKeyDown doesn't need the index param — just blur the target on Enter
  - autoFocus on empty patterns works well for newly added rows
  - Save on blur pattern avoids needing a dedicated save button
