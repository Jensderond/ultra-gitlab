## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Consolidated learnings - check this FIRST before starting work -->

### Architecture
- Database layer is in `src-tauri/src/db/` with pool.rs for connection management and mod.rs for initialization/migrations
- SQL migrations are stored in `src-tauri/src/db/migrations/` as .sql files
- Migration tracking uses a `_migrations` table in SQLite
- Models are in `src-tauri/src/models/` with one file per entity and mod.rs for re-exports
- All models derive `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, and `FromRow` for Tauri IPC and SQLx compatibility

### Conventions
- Use `Path` instead of `PathBuf` for function parameters per Clippy recommendation
- SQL statements in migrations must be parsed carefully - semicolons inside parentheses (e.g., `strftime('%s', 'now')`) don't end statements
- All database tests use `tempfile` crate for isolated test databases

### Gotchas
- SQLite doesn't support executing multiple statements in a single query - must split and execute individually
- When splitting SQL by `;`, need to track parenthesis depth to avoid splitting inside DEFAULT expressions

## 2026-01-30 - T006, T007, T008
**Workflow**: Speckit
**Feature**: 001-local-mr-review

### Implemented
- Created SQLite migration file with all 7 tables from data-model.md:
  - gitlab_instances, merge_requests, diffs, diff_files, comments, sync_queue, sync_log
- Implemented database initialization with migration runner in db/mod.rs
- Created SQLite connection pool with WAL mode in db/pool.rs
- Added tests for database initialization and idempotent migrations

### Files Changed
- src-tauri/src/db/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql (new)
- src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs (updated)
- src-tauri/src/db/pool.rs (new)
- src-tauri/Cargo.toml (added tempfile dev dependency)
- specs/001-local-mr-review/tasks.md (marked T006-T008 complete)

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- SQLite migration parsing requires tracking parenthesis depth to handle DEFAULT expressions with semicolons
- Clippy prefers `&Path` over `&PathBuf` for function parameters
- Tests use tempfile::tempdir() for isolated database testing

## 2026-01-30 - T009, T010, T011, T012, T013, T014
**Workflow**: Speckit
**Feature**: 001-local-mr-review

### Implemented
- Created all Rust model files matching data-model.md entities:
  - GitLabInstance with URL normalization
  - MergeRequest with state/approval enums and JSON field parsing
  - Diff and DiffFile with change type handling
  - Comment with inline/reply/general classification
  - SyncAction and SyncLog with status enums and retry logic
- All models derive Serialize (for Tauri IPC) and FromRow (for SQLx)
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all models

### Files Changed
- src-tauri/src/models/gitlab_instance.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/models/merge_request.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/models/diff.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/models/comment.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/models/sync_action.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs (updated with exports)
- specs/001-local-mr-review/tasks.md (marked T009-T014 complete)

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- Model enums use `From<&str>` trait for parsing database strings
- JSON fields (labels, reviewers) are stored as strings and parsed on demand
- SQLx FromRow requires field names to match column names exactly

## 2026-01-30 - T015
**Workflow**: Speckit
**Feature**: 001-local-mr-review

### Implemented
- Created AppError enum with all error variants needed for Tauri IPC
- Added Serialize impl using tagged enum format for frontend consumption
- Added From impls for sqlx::Error, reqwest::Error, serde_json::Error, and DbError
- Added builder methods for each error variant with optional context

### Files Changed
- src-tauri/src/error.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/lib.rs (added error module)
- specs/001-local-mr-review/tasks.md (marked T015 complete)

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- Use `#[serde(tag = "type", content = "details")]` for tagged enum serialization
- Use `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` to omit optional fields when None

## 2026-01-30 - T016, T017, T018
**Workflow**: Speckit
**Feature**: 001-local-mr-review

### Implemented
- Created GitLabClient with reqwest for GitLab API v4
- Added PRIVATE-TOKEN header authentication
- Implemented pagination parsing from X-Page, X-Total-Pages headers
- Added get_all_pages helper for fetching complete paginated results
- Created API types: GitLabMergeRequest, GitLabDiffVersion, GitLabDiscussion, etc.
- Implemented MR listing, diff fetching, discussions, approvals, and comments

### Files Changed
- src-tauri/src/services/gitlab_client.rs (new)
- src-tauri/src/services/mod.rs (updated with gitlab_client export)
- specs/001-local-mr-review/tasks.md (marked T016-T018 complete)

### Learnings for Future Iterations
- GitLab pagination uses X-Page, X-Per-Page, X-Total, X-Total-Pages, X-Next-Page headers
- Can't define structs inside impl blocks in Rust - move them outside
- Use `#[derive(Serialize)]` with `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` for optional query params
